# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of our analysis was to detemrine the credit risk of loans. We took into account the data of loan_stats to determine whether someone was of high risk or low risk. One way to conduct such a test is done by creating a model and than evaluating and training the model that was created. For this project, we were requested to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libararies to build models and than evaluate them using a resampling method. In the first few models, we use RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms to oversample the data. Next we created a undersampled model using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. We also created a model using a combination approach to over and undersample the data using smoteenn. Lastly, we compared two new machine learning models BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier. These helped us reduce bias while predicting credit risk.
